<p>Neptune is the eighth and most distant known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-biggest planet by distance across, the third-most-gigantic planet, and the densest earth. Neptune is multiple times the mass of Earth, marginally more gigantic than its close twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and genuinely littler than Uranus since its more noteworthy mass causes increasingly gravitational pressure of its environment. Neptune circles the Sun once every 164.8 years at a normal separation of 30.1 au (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman divine force of the ocean and has the cosmic image ♆, a stylised variant of the god Neptune's trident. 

Neptune isn't unmistakable to the independent eye and is the main planet in the Solar System found by scientific expectation instead of by experimental perception.</p></div>        <div class="w3-container">
          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>General characteristics</b></h5>
          <h6 class="w3-text-teal"><i class=" fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i></h6>
<p>Neptune's mass of 1.0243×1026 kg is halfway among Earth and the bigger gas mammoths: it is multiple times that of Earth yet only 1/nineteenth that of Jupiter. Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15 m/s2, 1.14 occasions the surface gravity of Earth, and outperformed uniquely by Jupiter. Neptune's tropical span of 24,764 km is almost multiple times that of Earth. Neptune, similar to Uranus, is an ice mammoth, a subclass of monster planet, since they are littler and have higher convergences of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn. In the quest for extrasolar planets, Neptune has been utilized as a metonym: found assortments of comparable mass are frequently alluded to as "Neptunes", similarly as researchers allude to different extrasolar bodies as "Jupiters". Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's climate is made fundamentally out of hydrogen and helium, alongside hints of hydrocarbons and potentially nitrogen, however it contains a higher extent of "frosts, for example, water, smelling salts and methane. In any case, like Uranus, its inside is essentially made out of frosts and rock; Uranus and Neptune are ordinarily considered "ice goliaths" to stress this differentiation. Hints of methane in the furthest locales to some degree represent the planet's blue appearance.</p>        <div class="w3-container">

<p>Rather than the dim, generally featureless environment of Uranus, Neptune's climate has dynamic and noticeable climate designs. For instance, at the hour of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern side of the equator had a Great Dark Spot similar to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These climate designs are driven by the most grounded continued breezes of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded breeze speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). As a result of its huge span from the Sun, Neptune's external climate is perhaps the coldest spot in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops moving toward 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's inside are around 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F). Neptune has a black out and divided ring framework (marked "bends"), which was found in 1984, afterward affirmed by Voyager 2.</p></div>
