<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of affection and excellence. As the second-most brilliant characteristic article in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, infrequently, is noticeable to the unaided eye in wide daylight. Venus exists in Earth's circle, thus never seems to wander a long way from the Sun, either setting in the west soon after nightfall or ascending in the east a piece before first light. Venus circles the Sun each 224.7 Earth days. With a turn time of 243 Earth days, it takes more time to pivot about its hub than any planet in the Solar System and does as such the other way to everything except Uranus (which means the Sun ascends in the west and sets in the east). Venus doesn't have any moons, a differentiation it imparts just to Mercury among planets in the Solar System.

Venus is an earthbound planet and is at times called Earth's "sister planet" in view of their comparable size, mass, nearness to the Sun, and mass structure. It is fundamentally not quite the same as Earth in different regards.</p>

<p>Venus is one of the four earthbound planets in the Solar System, implying that it is a rough body like Earth. It is like Earth in size and mass, and is frequently portrayed as Earth's "sister" or "twin". The measurement of Venus is 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)— just 638.4 km (396.7 mi) not exactly Earth's—and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface vary profoundly from those on Earth since its thick air is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with the greater part of the staying 3.5% being nitrogen.The Venusian surface was a subject of hypothesis until a portion of its privileged insights were uncovered via planetary science in the twentieth century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned pictures of a surface canvassed in residue and moderately rakish rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows proof of broad volcanism, and the sulfur in the climate may demonstrate that there have been late ejections. </p></div>

<p>Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.Current models of its interior imply a core with a radius of about 1,794 ± 65 kilometers (1,115 ± 40 mi), consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16–17% sulfur. This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as Earth's. The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km (31 mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 km (78 mi). Earth's crust averages 40 km (25 mi).</p><br>

Mars is seismically active, with InSight recording over 450 marsquakes and related events in 2019      </div>
